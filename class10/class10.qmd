#Instruction to PDB
>Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

```{r}
read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv")
```
```{r}
stats <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv",row.names=1)
head(stats)
```
```{r}
string <- c("10","100","1", "1,000")
numeric_vector <- as.numeric(gsub(",", "", string)) + 1
```

```{r}
x <- string
as.numeric(gsub(",", "", x))
```

```{r}
rm.comma <- function(x){
  as.numeric(gsub(",", "", x))
}

pdbstats <- apply(stats,2,rm.comma)
```

```{r}
rownames(pdbstats) <- rownames(stats)
pdbstats
```

```{r}
totals <- apply(pdbstats,2,sum)
round(totals/totals["Total"]*100,2)
```

> Q. Write a function to fix this non-numeric table



We can use the `gsub()` function.

Will add the rownames from the original wee table...


The percentage is 93.16

>Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

The main repository of structural data is the PDB. Let's examine what it contains.
At the time of writing, there are 183,201 protein structures
In UniProt, there are 251600,768 protein sequences.

```{r}
round(183201/251600768*100,2)
```

>Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

7434

#2 Visualizing structure
>Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?

There are no hydrogen atoms observed in the structure. It's smaller than the 2A resolution.

>Q5: There is a critical “conserved” water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have

308

>Q6: Generate and save a figure clearly showing the two distinct chains of HIV-protease along with the ligand. You might also consider showing the catalytic residues ASP 25 in each chain and the critical water (we recommend “Ball & Stick” for these side-chains). Add this figure to your Quarto document.

#Using the bio3d pakcage

```{r}
library(bio3d)

pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
pdb
```
```{r}
attributes(pdb)
```
```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```
```{r}
head(pdb$atom$resid)
```
```{r}
aa321(pdb$atom$resid[pdb$calpha])
```

#Predicting functional motions of a single structure

Run a Normal Mode Analysis (NMA) - a bioinformatics method to predict functional motions.

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
adk
```
```{r}
# Perform flexiblity prediction
modes <- nma(adk)
```

```{r}
plot(modes)
```
```{r}
mktrj(modes,pdb=adk,file="adk_m7.pdb")
```
